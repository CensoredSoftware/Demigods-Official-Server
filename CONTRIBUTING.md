Welcome to the team!
====================

Before you get started, you need to be aware of a few rules:

Issues
------
 - When creating an issue, make sure to be very specific about what it is you'd like to do/fix.
  - No vauge issues like "build spawn" or "fix titan world".
  - If you need to have some sort of vauge issue like this, create a milestone instead and add smaller issues (that are more descriptive) to said milestone.
 - Always apply a label to an issue you create.
  - This is important, we need to stay organized if we are to get things done.
  - You can (and should when applicable) apply more than one label to an issue.
  - Remember: Urgent =/= Important. Take care when deciding what to mark as urgent.
 - The person assigned to an issue is the lead on that issue.
  - Do not assign others unless you have talked to them about it beforehand.
  - If it is a sizable task, do not assign yourself without talking with others.
 - Only mark an issue complete when it is actually complete.
  - Exceptions to this rule exist (e.g. duplicate issues, obsolete issues, bad ideas).
 - ALL ISSUES MUST USE PROPER MARKDOWN FORMATTING.
  - GitHub will give you links (almost everywhere you can use Markdown on the site) to a special page that teaches you the syntax.  It's not very hard to learn, the DG forums already uses it for the commenting system.

 - The Creative Commons license DOES allow others to share your creation without giving you any notice (with restrictions).  If you are not okay with this, we may be able to work out a different license for your particular creation (it will be documented regardless).
 - Your creation will be used for promotion, this must be agreed upon (and publically announced) because of new FTC regulations.
  - The FTC regulation only applies to certain types of media, but you need to agree to this regardless.

We hope this clears things up for everyone.

Pay close attention to the commits in this repository, this agreement can, and probably will change in the future.


Thanks,
